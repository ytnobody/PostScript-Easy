PostScript/Easy version 0.01
==============================

PostScript::Easy allows you to have a simple method of writing PostScript
files from Perl. It has several graphics primitives that allow lines, circles,
polygons and boxes to be drawn. Text can be added to the page using standard
PostScript fonts.

Features include:

    Generation of multi-page PostScript files
    Generation of single-page EPS files
    Creating lines/circles etc.
    Rectangles and boxes
    Text
    Colour
    Pre-defined paper sizes
    Etc. etc.

does.
